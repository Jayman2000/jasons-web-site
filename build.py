	# exceedingly rare at the outset of text files that use other character
	# encodings. The corresponding UTF-8 BOM sequence, EF16 BB16 BF16, is
	# also exceedingly rare.”

	# it also requires HTML documents to have a “text” MIME type

	#
	# MIME requires the “canonical form” of text to use CRLFs. It also
	# forbids the use of CRs and LFs unless they’re part of a CRLF
	# (<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046.html#section-4.1.1>).
