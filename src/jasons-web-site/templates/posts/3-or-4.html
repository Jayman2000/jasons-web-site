<p>In <a href="posts/finding-the-right-ringcon-api.html" hreflang="en-US" type="text/html;charset=utf-8">my last post</a>, I talked about wanting to create a game that uses the <a href="https://ringfitadventure.nintendo.com/#ring-con" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Ring Fit Adventure</cite> accessories</a>. In addition to creating a game, <a href="posts/finding-the-right-ringcon-api.html#godot-asset" hreflang="en-US" type="text/html;charset=utf-8">I also want to make it easier for others to make games that use those accessories</a>. I guess that makes this a software project. For now I‚Äôll call it Jason‚Äôs Ring-Con Project. Maybe I‚Äôll come up with a better name for it later (probably not). More importantly, I need to figure out which version of the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Godot Engine</cite></a> I‚Äôm going to use for it.</p>
<p>The best platforms are ones that are improved over time. There is one unfortunate cost of improvement, though: maintenance. Any changes to a platform risk breaking software written for that platform. Even if the platform has <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235335/why-is-there-a-linux-kernel-policy-to-never-break-user-space" target="_blank" rel="external">a backwards compatibility guarantee</a>, there‚Äôs still a chance that <a href="https://linuxreviews.org/WE_DO_NOT_BREAK_USERSPACE" target="_blank" rel="external">unintentional breakages will happen</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/about/release_policy.html#godot-versioning" target="_blank" rel="external">According to Godot‚Äôs documentation,</a></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Godot loosely follows <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Semantic Versioning</a> with a <code>major.minor.patch</code> versioning system, albeit with an interpretation of each term adapted to the complexity of a game engine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>The <code>major</code> version is incremented when major compatibility breakages happen which imply significant porting work to move projects from one major version to another.</p>
				<p>For example, porting Godot projects from Godot 2.1 to Godot 3.0 required running the project through a conversion tool, and then performing a number of further adjustments manually for what the tool could not do automatically.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

<p>So, if I create something in <cite>Godot</cite> 3 now, then I‚Äôm going to have to do <q>significant porting work</q> in the future. If I create something in <cite>Godot</cite> 4 now, then it still looks like I‚Äôm going to have to do significant extra work. <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-2" target="_blank" rel="external">According to the release notes for the latest snapshot of <cite>Godot</cite> 4,</a></p>
<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>So here's Godot 4.0 alpha 2 with a great deal of fixes and new features!</p>
		<p>Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. <strong>There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>beta</em> release</a>.</strong> Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".</p>
		<p>As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.</p>

<p>So, would I rather put in extra work now or later? The answer is: now. At the moment, I‚Äôm willing to put significant time and effort into Jason‚Äôs Ring-Con Project. That won‚Äôt necessarily be true later. Plus, while I can‚Äôt know for sure, it also seems like starting with <cite>Godot</cite> 4 will result in less work overall. Finally, using <cite>Godot</cite> 4 will allow me to contribute to the future of <cite>Godot</cite>. Even if this project never comes to fruition, those contributions will still be valuable.</p>
<p>So, while it might be ill-advised, I‚Äôm going to use <cite>Godot</cite> 4.</p>
