	<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#def-world-wide-web" target="_blank" rel="external" hreflang="en">According to its most official definition</a>, <q>The <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> (<dfn><abbr>WWW</abbr></dfn>, or simply <dfn><abbr>Web</abbr></dfn>) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (<dfn><abbr>URI</abbr></dfn>).</q> Web addresses (or URIs as that document prefers to call them) are what truly make the Web stand out. Putting something as flexible as Web addresses at the center of the World Wide Web has made it uncensorable. Every time content at one Web address gets taken down, that same content can be reposted at two new ones. What I‚Äôm trying to say is: Web addresses are important. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been thinking about them.</p>

	<p>That same document goes on to say:</p>
	<figure>
		<blockquote>
<p>In the URI
"http://weather.example.com/", the "http" that appears before the
colon (":") names a URI scheme. Each URI scheme has a specification
that explains the scheme-specific details of how scheme identifiers
are allocated and become associated with a resource. The URI syntax
is thus a federated and extensible naming system wherein each
scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and
semantics of identifiers within that scheme.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<figcaption>‚Äî The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/" target="_blank" rel="external">W3C</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One</cite></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-scheme" target="_blank" rel="external">section 2.4. URI Schemes</a></figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Today, the most common URI scheme is <code>https</code>. That scheme is very similar to the <code>http</code> URI scheme which <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html" target="_blank" rel="external" hreflang="en">was one of the first URI schemes.</a> Those two facts lead me to one conclusion: <code>https</code> probably isn‚Äôt the best scheme. Surely someone has come up with something better in the past 30 years.</p>

	<p>The question remains though: if <code>https</code> isn‚Äôt the best scheme, then which one is? That is a difficult question to answer, and it‚Äôs almost certainly a subjective one. Even if <code>https</code> was the best scheme, it‚Äôs still a good idea to give it something to compete against. With that in mind, I‚Äôve decided that I want this site to promote scheme diversity. In other words, I want this site to be available under a variety of schemes.</p>

	<p>Early on, I made sure that this site supported the <code>file</code> URI scheme. After this site launched, I made it available at <a href="https://jasonyundt.website/" hreflang="en-US" type="text/html;charset=utf-8"><code>https://jasonyundt.website/</code></a>. Today, I‚Äôm proud to announce that the site is now available at <a href="ftp://jasonyundt.website/index.html" hreflang="en-US" type="text/html;charset=utf-8"><code>ftp://jasonyundt.website/index.html</code></a>.</p>

	<p>To be clear, FTP is almost certainly inferior to modern HTTPS. In fact, the only browser that I found that still supports it is <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/" target="_blank" rel="external" hreflang="en"><cite>Pale Moon</cite></a>, a browser that I do not recommend. I‚Äôm only really using FTP because I wanted to start with something that is more established and less experimental. In the future I plan to support some more interesting protocols</p>
