	<p>A while ago, I made a game called Simple Brick Breaker. The game isn‚Äôt exactly finished, but I‚Äôve decided to release a second pre-release version:</p>
	<p><a href="{{ generate_relative_url(relative_to_base, "posts/simple_brick_breaker_e47d55482f700b43cc6e0ea934c193b13e05e29e.zip") }}" download hreflang="en-US" type="application/zip"><strong>Click here to download Simple Brick Breaker (version e47d55482f700b43cc6e0ea934c193b13e05e29e).</strong></a></p>
	<p>The game (hopefully) works on Linux, macOS and Windows. I don‚Äôt have a versioning scheme for the game yet, so the version is just a git commit hash. Enjoy!</p>
	<p>Simple Brick Breaker uses Godot Engine version 3.4.4.stable.official.419e713a2. If you want the source code for that version of the Godot Engine, then please visit this page: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/getting_source.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/getting_source.html</a>.</p>
	<p>The Godot Engine source code contains a file named <code>ca-certificates.crt</code>. If you want the source code for <code>ca-certificates.crt</code>, then please take a look at the <code>thirdparty/README.md</code> file that‚Äôs inside Godot‚Äôs source code, and then take a look at the table that‚Äôs on this page: <a href="https://github.com/Jayman2000/ca-bundle-pr/tree/corresponding-source-for-old-commits#certdatatxt">https://github.com/Jayman2000/ca-bundle-pr/tree/corresponding-source-for-old-commits#certdatatxt</a>.</p>
