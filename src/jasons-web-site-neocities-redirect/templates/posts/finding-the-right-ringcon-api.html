<p>I really enjoy playing <a href="https://ringfitadventure.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Ring Fit Adventure</cite></a>, but it has a significant problem: it‚Äôs <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/" target="_blank" rel="external">cathedral-style</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank" rel="external">proprietary software</a>. To make matters worse, Nintendo goes out of their way to make it difficult to install mods on their systems, and <cite>Ring Fit Adventure</cite> remains the only Nintendo-approved game that uses the Ring-Con or Leg Strap (I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a non-Nintendo-approved one). This is unfortunate. There‚Äôs plenty of people who have ideas about how <cite>Ring Fit Adventure</cite> could be improved or ideas about how else the Ring-Con could be used. I‚Äôm one of these people, and I want to make a game that uses the Ring-Con.</p>
<p>The first problem I‚Äôve run into is input. Somehow, I have to give <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Godot</cite></a> (my game engine of choice) access to</p>
<ul>
	<li>the Joy-Con‚Äôs buttons,</li>
	<li>the Joy-Con‚Äôs analog sticks,</li>
	<li>the Joy-Con‚Äôs motion sensors and</li>
	<li>the Ring-Con‚Äôs flex sensor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, there is software out there that‚Äôs capable of collecting some or all of that information from Joy-Cons. Unluckily, the different software options aren‚Äôt necessarily compatible. For example, does <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2af16c1f846bd60240745bbd3afa13d5f040c61a" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Linux</cite>‚Äôs Joy-Con driver</a> use the same axis numbers as <a href="https://github.com/fossephate/JoyCon-Driver" target="_blank" rel="external">this one</a>? What about if you‚Äôre using <a href="https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>joycond</cite></a>? Even if I do find a combination of drivers that is consistent across platforms, will those drivers support the Ring-Con?</p>
<p>What I need is an API that will provide the data in a way that is consistent across multiple platforms.</p>

	<h2>Ideal UX</h2>
	<p>Ideally, here‚Äôs what the user should experience when they first start the game. It‚Äôs largely the same as what happens when users start <cite>Ring Fit Adventure</cite>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If the left Joy-Con isn‚Äôt connected, have the user connect it through their OS.</li>
		<li><i>(Optional)</i> Once the left Joy-Con is connected, have it give some sort of feedback to the user (something like setting the LEDs or vibrating).</li>
		<li>Once the left Joy-Con is connected, have the user put it in the leg strap and stand up</li>
		<li>If the right Joy-Con isn‚Äôt connected, have the user connect it through their OS.</li>
		<li><i>(Optional)</i> Once the right Joy-Con is connected, have it give some sort of feedback to the user (something like setting the LEDs or vibrating).</li>
		<li>If the Ring-Con isn‚Äôt connected, have the user connect it.</li>
		<li><i>(Optional)</i> Once the Ring-Con is connected, have the right Joy-Con give some sort of feedback to the user (something like setting the LEDs or vibrating).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In order to find the ideal API, I‚Äôm going to try to create a command-line program that walks the user through those steps. This will help me figure out what certain APIs are capable of and what they‚Äôre missing.</p>

	<h2>The candidates</h2>
	<section>
		<h3><a href="https://pypi.org/project/joycon-python/" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>joycon-python</cite></a></h3>
		<p>This library isn‚Äôt a good option in this scenario, but I‚Äôm still glad that I took a look at it. <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Python</a> is the programming language that I have the most experience with. Using a library written in Python gave me the opportunity to think through how I would implement the Ideal UX without worrying about learning a new language. Plus, it reminded me of something that I didn‚Äôt include in the Ideal UX: calibration. The experience in <cite>Ring Fit Adventure</cite> is so seamless that I didn‚Äôt even realize that calibration was necessary.</p>

		<p>That being said, <cite>joycon-python</cite> isn‚Äôt a good fit for my situation. For one thing, Python is never (rarely?) fully compiled. Maybe I‚Äôm just superstitious, but I would rather choose something that‚Äôs less likely to add latency. More importantly, the library lacks Ring-Con support and crashes unpredictably (at least, it does on my system).</p>

		<h3><a href="https://crates.io/crates/joycon-rs" target="_blank" rel="external"> KaiseiYokoyama‚Äôs <cite>joycon-rs</cite></a></h3>
		<p>At first glace, <cite>joycon-rs</cite> looked very promising. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/joycon-rs" target="_blank" rel="external">It‚Äôs well documented</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KaiseiYokoyama/joycon-rs/tree/master/examples" target="_blank" rel="external">provides some helpful examples</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/KaiseiYokoyama/joycon-rs#setup" target="_blank" rel="external">targets Linux, macOS and Windows</a>. Unlike the previous example, it‚Äôs written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Rust</a>. I‚Äôm not very familiar with Rust, but it seems like a good language for this task.</p>

		<p><cite>joycon-rs</cite> lacks Ring-Con support, but I would be more than willing to at least try adding Ring-Con support. The real problem is that <cite>joycon-rs</cite> doesn‚Äôt work properly on my system. I‚Äôm experiencing <a href="https://github.com/KaiseiYokoyama/joycon-rs/issues/65" target="_blank" rel="external">this issue</a>. <a href="https://github.com/KaiseiYokoyama/joycon-rs/issues/65#issuecomment-1000996015" target="_blank" rel="external">There is a workaround</a>, but I haven‚Äôt gotten it to work yet. Plus, it would nice if I didn‚Äôt have to tell users to install custom <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udev.html" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>udev</code></a> rules. That might be unavoidable, though.</p>

	<section>
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/Yamakaky/joy" target="_blank" rel="external">Yamakaky‚Äôs <cite>joy</cite></a></h3>
		<p>The first thing I noticed about <cite>joy</cite> was that its documentation is sparce. It is, however, the only software that I‚Äôm aware of that runs on <a href="https://kernel.org/linux.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Linux</a> and can read the Ring-Con‚Äôs flex sensor.</p>

		<p><cite>joy</cite> includes <cite>joytk</cite> a command-line application that can retrieve data from the Ring-Con. To implement the Ideal UX, I ended up copying a lot of code from that tool. Having it as an example was very helpful.</p>

		{# TODO: File relevant issues and link to them #}
		<p><cite>joy</cite>, like the other candidates, has it‚Äôs fair share of problems. The difference with <cite>joy</cite> is that the problems that I feel confident that I can fix the problems it has. Adding documentation is going to be easier than fixing random crashes, compensating for gyro drift is going to be easier that adding Ring-Con support, and turning the code that I copied into public functions is going to be easier that debugging Linux-specific <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bluetooth</a> problems.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Others?</h3>
		<p>There‚Äôs plenty of other software out there that provide some sort of Joy-Con support. It‚Äôs very possible that I missed the best one. One in particular that I skipped over was the <a href="https://microsoft.com/windows" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows</a>-only <a href="https://github.com/ringrunnermg/Ringcon-Driver" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Ringcon-Driver</cite></a>. Being multi-platform is a must for me, and I know very little about doing things the <a href="https://microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Microsoft</a> way (i.e., using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>.sln</code> files</a>, Windows APIs, etc.). Making Linux-only software work on Windows is going to be much easier for me than making Windows-only software work on Linux.</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The right API for my project is‚Ä¶ something that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. <cite>joy</cite>, however, appears to be a good starting point. Here‚Äôs the current plan:</p>
	<ol id="to-do-list">
		<li>Submit <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues" target="_blank" rel="external">issues</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests" target="_blank" rel="external">pull requests</a> to <cite>joy</cite>.
		<li>Investigate options for including Rust code in <cite>Godot</cite> games.</li>
		<li id="godot-asset">Create some sort of <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset" target="_blank" rel="external"><cite>Godot</cite> asset</a> that provides an API for interacting with Joy-Cons and Ring-Cons.</li>
		<li>Create an example project that implements the Ideal UX in <cite>Godot</cite>.</li>
		<li>Start creating a game!</li>
	</ol>
