# Jason’s Web Site

This repo holds what will eventually become my Web site.

## Building

This site is built using [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/). To try out
the site, run

1. `cd` to the `src/` directory.
2. Run `cobalt serve`
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

Once you do this, you’ll be able to find the contents of the site in the
`build/` directory.

## Hints for contributors

- You can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your
contributions. Follow [these instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)
to get started (skip the part about creating a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file).
- Every file should declare its own copying information. See the comment at the
top of `COPYING.md` for an example.

## Copying

See [COPYING.md](./COPYING.md).
