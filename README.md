# Jason’s Web Site

This repo holds what will eventually become my Web site.

## Building

At the moment, the site doesn’t need building because it’s entirely static
content. Just open the `static` directory and start editing. This will change
soon.

## Hints for contributors

- You can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your
contributions. Follow [these instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)
to get started (skip the part about creating a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file).
- Every file should declare its own copying information. See the comment at the
top of `COPYING.md` for an example.
- Use tabs for indentation. The only exception to this rule is in YAML files
because [YAML requires spaces for
indentation.](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#61-indentation-spaces) In YAML
files, use 4 spaces for indentation.

## Copying

See [COPYING.md](./COPYING.md).
